# Hey, I'm Mark

## I'm obsessed with building && learning things

My background is in **Full Stack Web Development** and **Data Engineering** (and animation haha), but I prefer working with lower level programming language and am attempting to upskill in them.

Currently, I work as a **Teacher's Assistant** for a Data Analytics course and tutor both Data Analytics and Full Stack students.

I'm obsessed with the intersection between code and reality. 

And birds.
