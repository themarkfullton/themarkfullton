A feral programmer weened off the teets of library books and search engines in the process of becoming "cultured."* Worked odd jobs freelance for four+ years and now working toward stabilizing profession. Currently working as a tutor and teacher's assistant. 

Passionate about Data Analysis, Dev Ops (Primary experience with Docker and Go), 2D Game Dev, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Web Dev.  

Obsessed with math, programming, and symbolic logic.

Knowledge tends towards being breadth-first (as opposed to depth-first) but that problem is in the process of being debugged. :-)
